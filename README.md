# Scraping German News Websites

Scripts to scrape large German news websites, used for my project on automating news media bias detection. To get the code, simply run 

```
git clone https://github.com/kssrr/german-media-scrape
```

If you are unfamiliar with git, you can copy-paste & run the `setup.R`-script, which will also install the dependencies for you. You can do a lot of interesting exploratory analysis with this kind of data, for example examine reporting on political parties:
